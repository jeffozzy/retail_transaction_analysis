Project Online Retail store

Online Retail store is a project to analyze sales over two years from a retail store. The analysis is done to understand the situation, Optimize pricing and inform marketing decisions.
Dataset Content

    The "Online Retail Transaction" dataset records customer purchases made through an online retail platform. It captures details such as the products bought, the quantity purchased, the transaction date and time, the price of each item, the unique customer identifier, and the country of the customerâ€™s location.

Business Requirements

    To get insights for price Optmization and marketing strategies

Hypothesis and how to validate?

    Price can be amended according to elasticicty to optimize pricing and marketing can be focused on country to country basis. To do these I will calculate elasticity to see what products we can reduce the prices and what products we can increase price. for 

Project Plan

    First I will load the dataset and do basic analysis to understand the dataset.
    Calculate pricing elasticty and identify key value items
    I made a copy of the original datset to preserve the integrity of the dataset
    Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations

    To explain to stakeholders in a way they can easily understand

Analysis techniques used

    List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
    How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
    Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
    How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

Ethical considerations

    There were none as this is not an actual business dataset, it is Hypothethical as was obtained from Kaggle


Unfixed Bugs

    Time was the biggest factor in this as the timeframe I was given was not enough for this analysis.
    I indetified economics gaps in my knowlegde and will have to go read up on economics theories again.

    

Development Roadmap

    Challenges i faced included not grapsping enough knowledge of maniplulating a large dataset 
    I was not Satisfied with the cleaning of my data
    I plan to spend more time reading about Pandas and Numpy as well as ecomics theories
    




Main Data Analysis Libraries

    Matplotlib.pyplot as plt ---> Used this to plpt chats
    Pandas  ----> used this for Data Analysis
    Numpy  ----> used this for Data Analysis
    Pipleline  ---> used this for handling missing values
